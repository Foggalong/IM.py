# IM.py

This program was used to track the connection status of Nightline IM services. It didn't track connection speeds, only whether it was be possible for a visitor to begin a chat or not. This has been **deprecated** since services switched from using [Mibew](https://mibew.org) to [Portal](https://portal.nightline.ac.uk).
